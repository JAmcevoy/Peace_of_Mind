# Peace Of Mind

[Peace Of Mind](https://jamcevoy.github.io/Peace_of_Mind/index.html)

Peace of Mind is a meditation site that hopes to help people better understand the ins and outs of meditation and why it is a beneficial practice.

This site is for all types of people and will have different methods of meditation for every situation. Along with the option to be added to an email list, which would be sent out weekly with motivational quotes and little tips and tricks on getting the most out of meditation.

## Features


### Existing Features

- __Navigation Bar__

  - Featured on all three pages, the navigation bar includes links to the Welcome to Peace Of Mind logo, Home page, Benefits, techniques, and Sign Up page and is identical on each page to allow for easy navigation.
  - I went for a more simplistic view of the option stacked and centered at the top of each page, Showing the user option across all pages.
  - This section will allow the user to easily navigate from page to page across all devices without having to revert back to the previous page via the ‘back’ button.

### Features Left to Implement

- Meditation audio section would be a feature I think my website would need to be complete. Unfortunately, with the layout, it looks like this would be a bigger task just to find a place to fit it. I would need to think more in-depth about where it fits in and why. Then apply the change to my code.

## Testing

- I tested that this page works in different browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Safari.

![Chrome](https://github.com/JAmcevoy/Peace_of_Mind/blob/main/assets/images/chrome.JPG)

![Firefox](https://github.com/JAmcevoy/Peace_of_Mind/blob/main/assets/images/firefox.JPG)

![Microsoft Edge](https://github.com/JAmcevoy/Peace_of_Mind/blob/main/assets/images/Edge%20(1).JPG)

![Safari](https://github.com/JAmcevoy/Peace_of_Mind/blob/main/assets/images/safari.jpg)


- I confirmed the site was responsive using the Chrome dev tools device toolbar.
- I can confirm that the nav and social links are reliable and easy to understand, Also the social links open in a new tab and open apps on mobile phones.
- I have confirmed the forms work, required entries in every field, the Radio button requires at least one to be selected, only accepts an email in the email field, and the submit button works.
- I have asked some family and friends to try the websites on a PC, laptop, and mobile phone (Andriod and iPhone).

### Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub)

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
